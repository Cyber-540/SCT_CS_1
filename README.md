# SCT_CS_1
This Python program implements a Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  The program allows the user to both encrypt and decrypt messages by specifying the mode and a shift value.
